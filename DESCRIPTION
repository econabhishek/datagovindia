Description: This wrapper allows the user to communicate with more than
    80,000 APIs posted on the open data portal data.gov.in - open data
    platform of the government of India.  The package allows you to search
    for the API required through the universe of the APIs with a better
    interface than the one website provides. Once a user has the ID by
    using the API discovery functionalities, the wrapper allows one to
    converse with the API using a consistent template.
